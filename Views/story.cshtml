          <p>One day, @Model.GetPerson1() and @Model.GetPerson2() were walking through the woods,
          when suddenly a giant @Model.GetAnimal() appeared. "@Model.GetExclamation()!"
          @Model.GetPerson1() cried. The <strong>two of</strong> them @Model.GetVerb() as quickly as possible,
          and when they were safe, @Model.GetPerson1() and @Model.GetPerson2() gave each other a giant @Model.GetNoun(). But, @Model.GetPerson1() had dropped their @Model.GetNoun2()! @Model.GetExclamation2() they screamed and ran back to fight the @Model.GetAnimal().  And they lost and were buried in an unmarked grave.</p>
